## Security Best Practices for Deployments

When deploying to production, enable:

```bash
# TLS
PRIVACY_TLS_ENABLED=true
PRIVACY_TLS_CERT_FILE=/certs/server.crt
PRIVACY_TLS_KEY_FILE=/certs/server.key

# Authentication
PRIVACY_AUTH_ENABLED=true
PRIVACY_AUTH_INTERNAL_KEYS_JSON='{"sk-xxx":{"name":"service","scopes":["*"]}}'

# Rate Limiting
PRIVACY_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
PRIVACY_RATE_LIMIT_DEFAULT="100/minute"
```

See [Production Security Documentation](./docs/production_security/) for details.
